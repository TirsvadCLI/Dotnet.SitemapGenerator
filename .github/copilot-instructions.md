# TirsvadCLI Sitemap Generator Library – AI Agent Instructions

## Project Overview
TirsvadCLI Sitemap Generator Library is a .NET 10 solution designed to create and manage sitemaps for websites. It follows a clean architecture approach, separating concerns across multiple projects to ensure maintainability and scalability. The solution includes domain models, application logic and infrastructure for data access.

## Architecture & Structure

### Core Dependencies
- **TirsvadCLI.SitemapGenerator.Domain** ← TirsvadCLI.SitemapGenerator.Core ← TirsvadCLI.SitemapGenerator.Infrastructure

### Key Projects
- **Domain**: Entities & business rules
- **Core**: Application logic, CQRS, services
- **Infrastructure**: EF Core, external services, email, file access
- **Tests**: Unit & integration tests

## C# Conventions
- Microsoft naming conventions
- `PascalCase` for types/methods
- `camelCase` for parameters/private fields
- Prefix interfaces with `I` (e.g., `IRepository`)
- Suffix async methods with `Async` (e.g., `GetByIdAsync`)
- Prefix private fields with `_` (e.g., `_repository`)
- Use `{}` for blocks except single-line `return`/`throw`
- Keep single-line blocks on one line (e.g., `if (x) return y;`)
- Prefer primary constructors for required dependencies
- Never use primary constructor parameters directly—assign to private fields

### Class Naming & Responsibility
- Use descriptive names; follow Single Responsibility Principle
- **Helper**: Static, pure functions, no state, very small
- **Manager**: Methods for a context, no state outside injected classes, business logic not in domain model
- **Mapper**: Transforms one object to another
- **Service**: Performs operations with side effects or orchestration, may have state
- **Handler**: Responds to requests, executes business logic via other classes

## Key Dependencies & Patterns
- **EF Core**: Data access (PostgreSQL default, easily changed to SQL Server)

### Central Package Management
- All package versions in `Directory.Packages.props`
- Use `<PackageReference Include="..." />` without Version attribute

## Quality Criteria

### File Naming Conventions
- Markdown: `.md` extension, lowercase, hyphens for spaces, no special characters.
- Mermaid diagrams: in markdown files.
- C# files: match class name, `.cs` extension.

```

### Preliminary analysis artifacts
- Milestones: Unique ID, versioned, clear title/description, related KPIs/FURPS+ IDs.
- Furps+: Unique ID, categorized requirements, clear descriptions.
  - ID format: FURPS-X-XXX (X=category initial, XXX=sequential number).
- KPIs: Unique ID, measurable metrics, clear definitions.
  - ID format: KPI-X-XXX (X=category initial, XXX=sequential number).
  - Metrics must be quantifiable and relevant to project goals.
- BMC: Unique ID, versioned, clear sections (key partners, activities, value propositions, customer relationships, channels, customer segments, cost structure, revenue streams).

### Artifact Documentation
- Artifacts must be versioned, stored centrally, and have unique identifiers.
- Artifacts must be written in markdown format where applicable.
- Maintain clear documentation, usage instructions, and dependencies for all artifacts.
- Usecases: Unique ID (UC-XXX), clear title, description, scope, actors, cross-references, reviewed/approved, assumptions documented.
- High Level Design (HLD): Domain Models (unique ID, clear attributes/relationships, versioned, cross-referenced), ERD (unique ID, cross-reference to DM), Use Case Brief (unique ID, overview, only success scenario), Use Case Casual (unique ID, flow of events, alternatives/exceptions), SSD (unique ID), Operation Contract (unique ID, cross-reference to SSD, define inputs/outputs/pre/postconditions).
- Low Level Design (LLD): Sequence Diagram (unique ID, cross-reference to OC/SSD, accurate interactions), Design Class Diagram (unique ID, cross-reference to DM/OC, accurate design).

### Compliance
- Adhere to legal/regulatory requirements.
- Maintain documentation for audits and reviews.
